This webpage was generated by running Vocco on its own source code.

These paragraphs are actually "notes" attached to the README -- they were automatically generated and included from ./notes/README.md. Notes can also be kept in the same directory as the source file, as long as it has the same name, plus one of the allowed format extensions; such as `app.rb.md`.

The supported note format extensions are: md, mkd, markdown, textile and rdoc.

Have a great day. &hearts;
