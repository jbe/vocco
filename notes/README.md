This webpage was generated by running Vocco on its own source code.

These paragraphs are actually "notes" attached to the README -- they were automatically generated and included from `./notes/README.md`. Notes can also be kept in the same directory as the source files, as long as their names correspond; like `app.rb.md` or `config.yml.textile`.

The supported note format extensions are: md, mkd, markdown, textile and rdoc.

Browse around the source code if you like -- mouse over the header just above this text to see a file list.
